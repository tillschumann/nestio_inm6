 * Stopwatch                                                           *
 *   Accumulates time between start and stop, and provides             *
 *   the elapsed time with different time units.                       *
 *                                                                     *
 *   Partly inspired by com.google.common.base.Stopwatch.java          *
 *   Not thread-safe: - Do not share stopwatches among threads.        *
 *                    - Let each thread have its own stopwatch.        *
 *                                                                     *
 *   Usage example:                                                    *
 *     Stopwatch x;                                                    *
 *     x.start();                                                      *
 *     // ... do computations for 15.34 sec                            *
 *     x.stop(); // only pauses stopwatch                              *
 *     x.print("Time needed "); // > Time needed 15.34 sec.            *
 *     x.start(); // resumes stopwatch                                 *
 *     // ... next computations for 11.22 sec                          *
 *     x.stop();                                                       *
 *     x.print("Time needed "); // > Time needed 26,56 sec.            *
 *     x.reset(); // reset to default values                           *
 *     x.start(); // starts the stopwatch from 0                       *
 *     // ... computation 5.7 sec                                      *
 *     x.print("Time "); // > Time 5.7 sec.                            *
 *     // ^ intermediate timing without stopping the stopwatch         *
 *     // ... more computations 1.7643 min                             *
